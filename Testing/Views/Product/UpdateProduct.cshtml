@*This Razor view provides a form for updating a product's name and price. It uses model binding to prepopulate the form fields with the current product data.
When the user submits the form, the data is sent to the UpdateProductToDatabase action in the Product controller, 
where the application can process the update based on the provided ProductID, Name, and Price.*@
@model Product

<h2>Update @Model.Name</h2>

@*This line starts an HTML form. The Html.BeginForm method creates a form that submits a POST request
to the UpdateProductToDatabase action method of the Product controller.*@
@using (Html.BeginForm("UpdateProductToDatabase", "Product", "Post"))
{
    @*This line creates a hidden input field for the ProductID property of the Product model. This ensures that when the form is submitted,
    the ProductID will be sent back to the server, allowing the action method to know which product is being updated.*@
    <input asp-for="ProductID" type="hidden" value="@Model.ProductID" />

    @*This section creates a label for the Name property and an input field for the user to enter the product name.
    The asp-for attribute on the label links it to the Name property, which enhances accessibility.
    The input field is populated with the current name of the product using value="@Model.Name".*@
    <label asp-for="Name" class="control-label">Name</label>
    <input type="text" name="Name" class="form-control" value="@Model.Name" />

    @*The step attribute allows decimal values to two decimal places. The control-label class is used to apply specific styles to label elements in forms.
    When applied, it typically adjusts the label's font size, weight, and spacing to make it visually distinct from regular text.*@
    <label asp-for="Price" class="control-label">Price</label>
    <input type="number" step="0.01" name="Price" class="form-control" value="@Model.Price" />

    @*This line creates a submit button for the form. When clicked, the form data will be sent to the specified action method to update the product.*@
    <input type="submit" value="Update Product" class="btn btn-primary" />
}
